This solution provides the following deployment options:

* http://qs_launch_permalink[Deploy {partner-product-name} into a new self-managed AD and VPC^]. This option builds a new AWS environment that consists of the VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, bastion hosts, and other infrastructure components. It then deploys a self-managed AD and an Amazon WorkSpaces and FreeRADIUS server into this new VPC. The self-managed AD is deployed on Amazon EC2 instances in different availability zones. This AD domain is used to create an AD Connector Directory Service, which is registered for Amazon WorkSpaces. Finally, a FreeRADIUS solution is deployed and MFA is enabled on this AWS Directory Service.
